# GarminWatchface
First Attempt at a watchface for the Garmin Vivoactive 3. This is mostly me experimenting, so I don't expect that I'll try and support other devices/languages.

## Todos

Quick notes, since I often forget.

* ~~Setup a background~~
    * ~~Image and background colors~~
    * ~~Plan for possible Dark and Light color schemes~~
* Determine what to display and the general layout
    * ~~Background~~
    * ~~Time~~
    * Date
    * ~~Step count~~
    * Disconnected bluetooth
    * Battery indicator (Percent or low indicator)
* ~~Allow dark/light mode though <settings>~~
* Setup animations?
    * Maybe a onExitSleep
* Consider a third color scheme/finalize colors
* Optimizations
* Consider testing? (Depending on how complex this gets)

## Notes

The font used for the numbers is "Tex Gyre Adventor"

Watch background and theme will be inspired by the Angel Beats logo. I still really like the simple design, plus I may actually have heart stats.

Walking Icon is from Google Material Design.
