# GarminWatchface
First Attempt at a watchface for the Garmin Vivoactive 3, using the recommended Eclipse environment.. This is mostly me experimenting, so I don't expect that I'll try and support other devices/languages. This is mostly since I don't own or speak them...

## Todos

Things I'll look into if I get the time:
* Improve light theme/add options for a dark blue or something
* Add Tests
* Change Midnight to 12 instead of 0 hours
* Add app option for different date formats
* Setup animations?
* Consider adding tests (Depending if this gets complex)

## Notes

The font used for the numbers is "Tex Gyre Adventor"

Watch background and theme will be inspired by the Angel Beats logo. I still really like the simple design.

Icons are from Google Material Design. (Walking Person, Battery and Bluetooth)
